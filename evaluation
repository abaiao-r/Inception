The Docker Wall, Hillary's Emails, and Fake News Bonanza

Alright, everybody, listen up. We've got this incredible Docker project – it's like building a wall, a tremendous virtual wall. And you know what we're keeping out? Illegal containers. No more sneaky containers crossing the border, folks.

We're securing it just like we want to secure our borders. Nobody builds walls better than me, and these Docker containers, they're gonna be top-notch. No illegal activities getting through, believe me.

Now, speaking of security, we're doing it better than Hillary did with her emails. No private Docker servers, no missing containers – it's gonna be the most secure project you've ever seen.

And then there's the fake news. They'll tell you, 'Oh, just use DockerHub, it's easy.' No, that's fake news, folks. We're building our own containers – the best containers, okay? No shortcuts, no fake news. Just real, tremendous containers.

So, in conclusion, we're building a wall around this Docker project, securing it like nobody else. No illegal activities, no fake news, just security and greatness. Thank you, everybody! It's gonna be a winner.
